If i were to look at the creation without any prior knowledge or suggestion or interpretation i would think that existence is originally dark, the normal state of the universe is darkness and that light is emergent. Because everything that we see when there is light is there when the light is gone but light requires constant supplement. Ä°t is stable, it is there.
